## README

This script, `dns_resolver2.py`, is used to resolve the IP address of a specific domain name and update an AWS managed prefix list with the resolved IP addresses.

The script performs the following steps:

1. Resolves the 'A' record (IP address) of the domain 'collectors.eu.sumologic.com'.
2. Converts the IP addresses to CIDR notation and adds them to a list with a description.
3. Retrieves the current version of a specified AWS managed prefix list.
4. Updates the AWS managed prefix list with the new entries.

To run the script, replace `<your-prefix-list-id>` with your actual prefix list ID and execute the script with Python.

Please ensure all prerequisites are met before running the script.
